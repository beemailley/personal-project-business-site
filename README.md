# Rock Collectors - Business Site

There were a few things required for this project:
A header with responsive image or video; a sign-up with at least three different input types; an FAQ with JavaScript; and styling.

I originally worked on this project with a team, and our team's website can be found here: https://endearing-gumption-b7923c.netlify.app/

However, I wanted to practice several of the things we learned as a team, and so built my own site linked below.

## The problem

I took the opportunity to practice CSS styling, including CSS grid; how to build a hero video with a text overlay; and how to include basic JavaScript.
